# Spam-Email-Classification

My interest in Applied Machine Learning was first kindled during my research stint at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur under Professor Vipul Arora, of the Electrical Engineering Department, just after my first year of Undergraduate Study. The project entitled Analysis of ML Algorithms for Spam Email Classification in Python involved a detailed analysis of K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. I also implemented Naive Bayes and KNN for the classification of various data sets into spam and ham. Extensive use was made of the Keras, Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-Learn libraries. I also comapred accuracy rates for various data sets and categorised the best method for each data set. My presentation on my findings received special mention from the Professor.
